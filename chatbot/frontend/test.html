        <h2>Introduction to Physical AI</h2>
        <p>Physical AI represents a paradigm shift from traditional digital AI to embodied intelligence that interacts with the physical world. Unlike conventional AI systems that process data in virtual environments, Physical AI systems must navigate the complexities of real-world physics, dynamics, and environmental uncertainties.</p>
        
        <h2>Humanoid Robotics</h2>
        <p>Humanoid robots are designed to resemble and mimic human behavior and appearance. They represent one of the most challenging areas of robotics, requiring sophisticated control systems, advanced sensors, and complex algorithms to achieve human-like movement and interaction.</p>
        
        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <p>The applications of Physical AI and humanoid robotics span numerous fields including healthcare, manufacturing, entertainment, and service industries. These systems promise to revolutionize how humans interact with technology in their daily lives.</p>
