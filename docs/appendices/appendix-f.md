# Appendix F: Cloud vs On-Premise Lab Setup

## F.1 On-Premise Lab Setup
Advantages:
- Complete control over hardware and software configurations
- No network latency for real-time robotic control
- Direct hardware access for debugging and development
- Data security and privacy for sensitive projects

Requirements:
- Physical space for robot operation and testing
- High-performance computing hardware (GPUs, workstations)
- Network infrastructure for robot communication
- Safety equipment and operational procedures

## F.2 Cloud-Based Lab Setup
Advantages:
- Scalable computing resources for simulation and training
- Remote access capabilities for distributed teams
- Pre-configured environments and tools
- Cost-effective for short-term projects

Requirements:
- High-bandwidth, low-latency network connections
- Cloud computing resources (AWS, Azure, GCP)
- Simulation environments for testing
- Secure remote access protocols

## F.3 Hybrid Approach
Many Physical AI projects benefit from a hybrid approach:
- On-premise for real robot testing and validation
- Cloud for simulation, training, and heavy computation
- Careful data synchronization between environments
- Consistent development and deployment pipelines

## F.4 Decision Factors
Consider these factors when choosing your lab setup:
- Project timeline and budget constraints
- Hardware requirements and availability
- Team collaboration needs
- Security and data privacy requirements
- Performance requirements for real-time applications
